Both pictures feature a black design on a white background. The design consists of a curved line that forms a U-shape, with a small circle at the top and a larger circle at the bottom. The design is symmetrical, with the curved line and circles mirroring each other.

The visual harmony of the two pictures is similar, as they both feature the same design. However, there is a slight difference in the size of the circles. The circle at the bottom of the design is larger in the picture labeled R compared to the one labeled L.

In terms of design, both pictures are equally good. The symmetry and simplicity of the design make it visually appealing. However, the larger circle at the bottom of the design in the picture labeled R adds a bit more visual interest compared to the smaller circle in the picture labeled L. Therefore, the picture labeled R is slightly better in terms of visual harmony.",Right,R,T,E,3
2,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PON2020/vast/main/image2.png.png,"The image depicts two distinct designs, each with its own unique characteristics. The design on the left, labeled L, features a combination of curved and straight lines, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. The design on the right, labeled R, presents a more fluid and organic shape, with smooth curves that evoke a sense of elegance and simplicity.

In terms of visual harmony, both designs have their merits. The L design has a more structured and balanced composition, with a clear division between the upper and lower sections. The R design, on the other hand, has a more fluid and continuous flow, with the curves blending seamlessly into one another.

When it comes to choosing the better design, it ultimately depends on personal preference. The L design may appeal to those who appreciate structure and balance, while the R design may resonate with those who prefer fluidity and elegance. However, if we were to make a clear and unambiguous choice based on visual harmony, the R design would be the better option. Its fluid curves and organic shape create a more cohesive and visually pleasing composition that is pleasing to the eye.",Right,L,F,E,3
