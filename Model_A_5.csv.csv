There are two pictures in this image: the one on the left is labeled L, and the one on the right is labeled R. Describe both pictures, using your sensitivity to aesthetics to evaluate them. Then tell me which one is the better design. You must make a clear and unambiguous choice, and justify it. Keep your response under 200 words.
ASSISTANT: The picture on the left is L and the picture on the right is R. I prefer the picture on the right because it is more abstract and has more detail.",R,L,F
